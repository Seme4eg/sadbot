#+title: sad discord music bot

Discord bot that utilizes discordgo, gopus, yt-dlp and ffmpeg to stream music
from host machine, YouTube, SoundCloud and other streaming platforms to user's
voice channel.

Right now my network capabilities are far below what's needed to host this bot
myself.

** Usage
Create a ~config.yml~, set your bot token there.

All commands below should be prefixed with prefix that is set in =config.yml=
(default ~&~).

# this section should copy 'help.go' file
- ~help~ - Show help message.
- ~p | play [<Title | URL>]~ - Resume paused playback. If <title | url> argument
  was given plays links from youtube & soundcloud.
- ~pf | playfolder <path>~ - Play music from local folder (bot hoster only).
- ~pause~ - Pause current playback.
- ~stop~ - Stop current playback, clears queue.
- ~next | skip~ - Skip to next song assuming there is one.
- ~skipto <index>~ - Skip to song with <index> (look it up in queue) assuming
  there is one.
- ~clear~ - Clear current queue.
- ~leave~ - Leave the channel, clears queue, resets shuffle & repeat states.
- ~repeat single/all/off~ - Repeat current track. Repeat all queue. Disable
  repeat.
- ~loop~ - Same as _repeat all_.
- ~(un)shuffle~ - (un)Shuffle the queue.
- ~q | queue~ - Show current queue.
- ~np~ - Show current track name.

** Dependencies
- *ffmpeg*
- *yt-dlp*
- *cgo*

/Note/: as a downloader in yt-dlp i am using ffmpeg, another option is to use
aria2 but my aim was to keep this project minimal in terms of dependencies.

** Todos
- Reply f-n now deletes prev message always, even if it's from prev session,
  which isn't a big deal, but is an unobvious behaviour, subject for fix
- maybe add some more options to config? like how many tracks to show in queue?
- teach bot to leave after x time when no1 in voice
- [[https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo@v0.27.1#Session][sharding]] and ~shards~ command to display info on shards status
- duration output in queue
- cleanup on interrupt, many goroutines report error from audio package
- after interrupting (or queue end):
  - error nexting: either last song in the queue or no songs in it
  - Error streaming: either last song in the queue or no songs in it
- should each song has it's own 'playback' process in its struct? will it be
  easier to manage playback then?
- _commands_:
  - ~ping~ command to show actual ping
  - ~stats~ command
  - ~radio~ Endless auto-generated radio based on selected genre.
